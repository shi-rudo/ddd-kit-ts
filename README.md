## About

`@shirudo/ddd-kit` is a lightweight, composable toolkit designed to help developers implement tactical Domain-Driven Design patterns in TypeScript. It provides a set of simple, unopinionated building blocks that you can use to create robust and maintainable domain models.

## Getting Started

To get a feel for how the toolkit works, you can explore the "Rugby Match" example included in the `examples/rugby` directory.

### Running the Example

To run the example, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx tsx examples/rugby/main.ts
```

This will simulate a rugby match, demonstrating how aggregates, events, and state changes work together.

### Running Tests

To run the test suite for the project, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm test
```

This will execute all tests and provide a report of the results.
